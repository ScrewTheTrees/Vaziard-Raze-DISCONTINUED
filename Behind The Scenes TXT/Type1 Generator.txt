Few Rules:
StartY or EndY may never,ever, go below MinHeight, or above MaxHeight
U shapes for lifu
Always add +96 to the StartX after a module has generated
Ceiling blocks may not be within 288 blocks of a ground block (and vice versa)
Platforms must not have a collision with ground/ceil blocks in a (-96,-288,+96,+288) area around them
Dont forget to start/end the generator outside the room boundaries so that spec cam has some move room (768 pixels should do it), also makes it a bit leeway for the generator.



Debug nodes:     Dot / Line

0=end (empty) --- Red/Purple --- End of a module, show line to next module
1=start ceiling --- Orange/Orange --- Shows line running along ceiling
2=start ground --- Green/Green --- shows line running along ground
3=start stairs --- yellow/yellow --- shows line running along the stairs
4=start platform --- c_lime/c_lime --- Shows line running along a platform.
5=Fill Platform --- c_lime/Noone --- Shows a big dot on a block that was generated between blocks to fill an empty and untraversable space

10=total void --- Noone/Noone --- Shows nothing, pretty much an empty point
11=Void with red dot ---Red/Noone --- Shows the 0 end of module dot without a line




There is a red line showing the way between the entrance/exit

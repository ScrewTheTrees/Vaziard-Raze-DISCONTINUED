Few Rules:
StartY or EndY may never,ever, go below MinHeight, or above MaxHeight
U shapes for lifu
always add +96 to the StartX after a module has generated
Ceiling blocks may not be within 288 blocks of a ground block (and vice versa)
Platforms must not have a collision with ground/ceil blocks in a (-96,-288,+96,+284) area around them
Dont forget to start/end the generator outside the room boundaries so that spec cam has some move room (768 pixels should do it), also makes it a bit leeway for the generator.

*Created log

*Overhauled sprite system to be index based, not weapon based. allows for more than 1 sprite per weapon which will really help with more complicated weapon art (still flash framed art thou).
*Added more attributes to the weapon attribute system.
*Changes to some stat updating.
*Reformated certain code to work differently.
*change minor elements to the movement to make jumping more fluid.

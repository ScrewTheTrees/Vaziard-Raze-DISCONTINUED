  "body": "Old discontinued version, Had a bad system set in place and the 39dll commit was pretty trash, ive remade my engine to work... better, but it was rewritten from scratch.\r\n\r\nTo run you need Game Maker: Studio, preferable above 1.4 for maximum support, however there is a runnable .exe in the runtime directory.\r\n\r\nBe vary that the online does not work correctly, i managed to mess up the netcode by accident lately, you could probably get it to work if you really tried... its probably a minor bug.",
